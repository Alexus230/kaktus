# Kaktus

Unofficial mobile feed reader for Netvibes.com. Works on 
Sailfish OS, Symbian, Meego & BlackBerry10 devices.

Kaktus is an unofficial client of Netvibes.com service. Using 
this app you can fetch, browse and read all your RSS feeds 
in convenient way. App recognizes Feed and Multi-Feed widgets 
configured on tabs and dashboards of your Netvibes account.

Kaktus is working in sync mode, so network connectivity is not 
required all the time. The significant feature is possibility 
to read articles in offline mode, so without a network usage. 
In such mode, previously downloaded content of web pages are 
displayed from local cache.

To run the application, you must already have a Netvibes.com 
account - new sign up form app is not possible. If you don't 
have an account, you can create one on Netvibes.com home page. 
Currently only sign in with Netvibes credentials is 
supported - sign in with Twitter, Facebook or Google+ will be 
added in the future releases.
